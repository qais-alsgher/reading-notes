# Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

### Types of Graphs:

1. Finite Graphs

    A graph is said to be finite if it has a finite number of vertices and a finite number of edges. 

2. Infinite Graph:

   A graph is said to be infinite if it has an infinite number of vertices as well as an infinite number of edges. 

3. Trivial Graph: 

   A graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph contains only one vertex and no edge. 


4. Simple Graph:

   A simple graph is a graph that does not contain more than one edge between the pair of vertices. A simple railway track connecting 
different cities is an example of a simple graph. 

5. Multi Graph:

    Any graph which contains some parallel edges but doesnâ€™t contain any self-loop is called a multigraph. For example a Road Map. 

6. Null Graph:

    A graph of order n and size zero is a graph where there are only isolated vertices with no edges connecting any pair of vertices.

7. Complete Graph:

    A simple graph with n vertices is called a complete graph if the degree of each vertex is n-1, that is, one vertex is attached with n-1 edges or the rest
of the vertices in the graph. A complete graph is also called Full Graph. 

8. Pseudo Graph:
    A graph G with a self-loop and some multiple edges is called a pseudo graph. 

9. Regular Graph:

  A simple graph is said to be regular if all vertices of graph G are of equal degree. All complete graphs are regular but vice versa is not possible.


10. Bipartite Graph:

11. Labeled Graph:

12. Digraph Graph:

13. Subgraph:

14. Connected or Disconnected Graph:

15. Cyclic Graph:

 ## Graph vs Tree
 
|  different | Graph|  Tree|
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| Structure | Graph is a non-linear data structure.   | Tree is a non-linear data structure.|
| Edges |	Each node can have any number of edges.	If there is n nodes then there edges. |would be n-1 number of edges|
|Types of Edges| They can be directed or undirected|	They are always directed|
|Root node| There is no unique node called root in graph|	There is a unique node called root(parent) node in trees.|
|Loop Formation| A cycle can be formed.|	There will not be any cycle.|
|Traversal| 	For graph traversal, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).|	We traverse a tree using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods.|
|Applications| 	For finding shortest path in networking graph is used.|For game trees, decision trees, the tree is used.|
