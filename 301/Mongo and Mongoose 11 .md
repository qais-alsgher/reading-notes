| SQL | 	NoSQL | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
|SQL databases are table based databases  |NoSQL databases are document based, <br/>key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores | 
| SQL databases have predefined schema whereas | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data | 
| SQL databases are vertically scalable |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable |
| SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware | NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data|NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents |

# What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

# Give a real world example.

business application

# What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

# Give a real world example.

 Twitter

# Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

# Which type of database is best for scalability?


 NoSQL 

# What does SQL stand for?

structured query language

# What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

# What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Tables

# What is a ‘schema’?

A database schema is defines how data is organized within a relational database

# What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases re non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.

NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document,

key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts 

of data and high user loads.

# How does it work?

Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

NoSQL databases are built from the ground up to store and process vast amounts of data at scale and support a growing number of modern businesses.


# What is inside of a Mongo database?

documents

collections 

data 

# Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB because these databases can manage large volumes of data or requests and It includes features for automatic scaling

# What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Scalability and its decentralized style. It supports distributed structures.

They’re usually much more open and flexible as databases. They allow adapting to the needs of a project in a much easier way than entity related models.

Changes in the schemes can be done without having to stop the database.

Horizontal scaling: they’re capable of growing in device number, instead of having to reside in one large device.

They can be run on low-resource devices.

Query optimization on databases designed for large amounts of data.
